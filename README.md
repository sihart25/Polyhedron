# Polyhedron
The aim of this assessment was to produce a matrix to represent rotation about an axis specified by two spherical polar angles, and to write a program to read, transform, light, project and render a set of polyhedrons, as specified in a data file. All the required features have been implemented, and the following extra features have been added. Multiple cameras, lights and polyhedrons can be read from the data file. The cameras can be moved interactively using the mouse and keyboard. The lights can be point or directional sources, with ambient, diffuse, and specular components. The polyhedrons have material properties with ambient, diffuse, specular and emissive components. Each polyhedron can have axes attached to it to show its local co-ordinate system. The polyhedrons can be rendered as solids or wire-frames. The rendered scene can be saved to a bitmap file.
