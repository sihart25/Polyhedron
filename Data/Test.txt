Arbitrary values are used to test the rotation matrix.
theta = 50.7227
phi = 17.3974
psi = 72.7866

The rotation matrix is generated.
Matrix = (
(0.680104, -0.484345, 0.550334),
(0.725092, 0.333647, -0.602429),
(0.108166, 0.808758, 0.578110))

The origin is rotated onto itself.
Vector = (0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000)
Vector = (0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000)

A point on the axis is rotated onto itself.
Vector = (0.738679, 0.231451, 0.633075)
Vector = (0.738679, 0.231451, 0.633075)

An arbitrary point is rotated around the axis.
Vector = (0.350291, 0.479873, 0.585009)
Vector = (0.327761, 0.061675, 0.764190)

The distances of the arbitrary point and the rotated point from the axis are equal.
distance = 0.463540
distance = 0.463540

The angle between the arbitrary point and the rotated point is equal to psi.
angle = 72.786645

The product of the matrix and its transpose is the identity matrix.
Matrix = (
(1.000000, -0.000000, 0.000000),
(-0.000000, 1.000000, 0.000000),
(0.000000, 0.000000, 1.000000))
